# VREP-motion-planning-machi-SRA166
Educational Project on motion planning with inverse kinematics of robotic arm SRA-166 on VREP

In this project i've set up the robotic arm from a CAD file. I split it in different parts and implemented the inverse kinematics.
Using a Lua script i've generated a path according to a spiral-like function and set the end effector of the robot to follow it.
